    <h2>Backpacking in the Sespe Wilderness</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">April 08, 2019</p>
    
    <p>With a grunt, I pulled my pack up from the ground, leaning forward so the weight would fall squarely on my back as I pulled it around. Still facing the ground I clipped the waist strap and pulled, feeling it tighten and the weight settle on my hips as I stood. With a shiver, I looked around the familiar parking lot, that we had visited many times over the years. It was colder than it had ever been, it was our first time coming in the winter, and we were expecting bad weather. With one last look at the car, which too had been upgraded from our first trip, we set off along the familiar trail, that differed only in the glittering frost covering the plants.</p>

<p>It all began around four years ago, I had just gotten my driver’s license so naturally, my friends and I packed up to go on our first parent-free backpacking trip. This was the first of many trips that we would take into the Sespe Wilderness. Our first trip was a three-day weekend in the spring, with four overpacked and nervous teenage girls. Even though it was spring, the temperatures soared and we found ourselves hating the seemingly never-ending series of ups and downs. On the trail, we only passed a few groups but did see a pack of boy scouts scurrying around in a little valley around halfway to Willett.</p>

<p>The first time we did this trip we didn’t even make it to Willett Campground and ended up settling at Oak Flat for the first night. The next day, we left our camp and continued on in the hopes of finding Willett’s hot tub for a quick day soak.</p>

<p>The simplest way to find Willett Hot Tub is to follow the main trail and wait for a sharp right down a decently steep short incline to a very shallow and wide river crossing. After crossing the river one should continue along the trail for about 5 minutes and then turn left down a well traveled incline that splits off from the main trail. Here one must cross the river bed and continue straight towards the mountains. At the very base of the mountains there is a cabin and a group of shacks next to an open horse pasture. In front of these cabins you will find a trail running along the base of the mountains, following this trail will lead up the mountain to the Willett Hot Spring tub. In recent years, the trail up to the hot tub has become increasingly sketchy. At points the ground consists of a thin layer of slippery gravel, over hard packed dirt with a near sheer drop off on one side, and on the other side loose dirt with nothing to grip onto. (Keep in mind going down will be worse than going up) At the top of the hill there will be a small flat clearing, where people sometimes camp, right before a clump of trees and brush. To find the tub, one must go straight into the brush, and follow the water uphill.</p>

<p>In future trips, we were able to make it to Willett in 1 day, roughly 14 miles, and were even lucky enough to stay in the cabin for a night. And yet we were never able to make it all the way to Sespe Hot Springs. We had always turned back too soon, once even stopping right before the last uphill before the trail division, giving up before seeing the old rusted sign pointing to Sespe. Regardless, this winter, more than four years after our first trip we finally made it all the way to Sespe Hot Springs. There we bathed in the warm stream under the starlight, exhausted but extremely pleased with ourselves.</p>

<p>We learned from all of our old mistakes and gave ourselves four days rather than the usual three to more comfortably travel the distance. The first night was the hardest, the entire night it rained while we huddled together in one of the old shacks at Willett listening to the rain hit the corrugated steel and the wind shake the structure late into the night. The next day the clouds cleared and we continued on to Sespe where we relaxed and melted off the fatigue from the miles logged.</p>

<p>At the end of four days, we left the wilderness relaxed, covered in the mud and ready to face the new year. Perhaps it was the fact we had failed so many times, or perhaps it was the company, the chance to reconnect with old high school friends, but overall we were left with feelings of excitement and energy that overshadowed the deep exhaustion of our muscles.</p>

<h4 id="a-few-noteworthy-tidbits">A few noteworthy tidbits</h4>

<p>Hiking in the summer is miserable, endless up and downs in the burning heat, and a constant desire to stop at any available water source and lay down in the shade. The winter faces its own issues, unpredictable weather and a constant cold. And yet, the winter is so much better, albeit more crowded, the warmth of Willett and Sespe gently pull you away from the cold and offer a reprieve that though it only lasts for less than an hour, feels longer than the time spent agonizing with every step. In addition, dogs are welcome on the trail, and many groups are accompanied with furry companions, some even with their own pack. On one occasion Raven, my black lab, joined us on an excursion and ended the trip with beat up paws, so if traveling with a dog I would suggest either going in the winter or buying your dog some shoes.</p>
