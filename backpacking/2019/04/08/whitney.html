    <h2>Whitney</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">April 08, 2019</p>
    
    <p>It was my first solo backpacking trip and I had high expectations. I was going to climb Mt. Whitney during a five-day trip through the High Sierras. It was the most mentally and physically difficult trip I have ever done. I planned to hike ~12 miles into Rock Creek through Cottonwood Pass on the first day, the next day ~7 miles to Guitar Lake, and on the third day I would summit Mt.Whitney and return to Guitar Lake. My last two days I would hike out to Rock Creek, and then all the way out of Cottonwood Pass. It was a fantastic plan. I still stand by it. It would have split the distances up perfectly.</p>

<p>There was one small problem, elevation. The morning of September 22nd I woke up at 4am from my home in LA and drove three hours to the Eastern Interagency Center to get a five-day walk-in permit for Cottonwood Pass. By 9am I had the pass in hand and had already ascended ~9,000 ft on a narrow winding road to the base of the Cottonwood Pass Trail. By 11am I was at Chicken Spring Lake (~11,200 ft) refilling water. That was as far as I got. I tried to keep going, but all of a sudden I was hit by fatigue, every step left me out breath and my head swirling. Realizing I could go no further I painstakingly began setting up camp. Every step exhausted me as preparations stretched themselves over a couple of hours. Wearily I forced myself to eat a couple of bites before cuddling up in my sleeping bag to a fitful night of sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning I woke up tired but not light-headed. Where the night before a couple of steps would leave me out of breath, now I could walk at least 100 ft and only be panting slightly. I mention this for one crucial point, ALLOW TIME FOR ACCLIMATION. Some small little version of me was still determined to get to the top of Mt. Whitney, so with a small sigh I decided to hike to Crabtree from Chicken Spring, a distance of approximately ~15 miles. It was a hard day filled with constant elevation change, and barely any flat. On the way I ran into two rangers, one of which who asked for my full name, leaving me with a sick feeling that she surely thought I was going to die. (I realize this is just a safety thing, but at the time it scared me) I arrived just after dark at lower Crabtree and began plotting my Whitney ascent.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 24th at 8am I began the path to Whitney. People who say it is easy are either in phenomenal shape or are simply lying. Every step I took after Guitar Lake on those 11 switchbacks was hell. I had already spent hours walking up hill to simply get to that point and was quite done going up, but I still had ~2,500 ft of vertical elevation to gain. I honestly don’t know where I found the willpower to keep going. Every time I stopped to catch my breath I told myself it would be okay to just turn around, but some part of me kept pushing, it told me I didn’t have to quit. I knew no one, including myself, would be disappointed if I had to turn around, and yet I kept going.</p>

<p>At 3:30 pm I finally saw the hut at the top. I somehow found the energy to smile as I forced my feet through the final couple hundred feet. At the hut I dropped my bag and looked at the uninterrupted views from every side. The site is something that cannot be captured by photos, or at least not my photos. There is sort of a delirious excitement to being at the very top. I couldn’t help but smile to myself as I climbed on top of a rock and thought to myself that I am higher than every other person on land in the U.S. Going down, I flew, every step was easy as I smiled at my own accomplishments, even with my speed I arrived at my campsite after nightfall, again.</p>

<p>The next day, I slept in. When I woke I felt as though my body had been beaten with a bag of bricks and then dragged behind a truck. Slowly and with a heaping plateful of pain I packed up camp and made my way to Rock Creek. Up until this point I have not addressed what it is like being alone in the wilderness. For each person I am sure it is drastically different. For me, my perception of it varied vastly with the time of day. In the mornings I woke up peaceful and content, in awe of the beauty and sounds that surrounded me. Around sunset the loneliness and silence would always hit me for an hour or so, my mind would leap into overdrive analyzing all the things that could possibly go wrong. After my panic, I was always left with a feeling of acceptance, that I was simply adrift in the world and should not worry about my place.</p>

<p>I mention this for one reason only, an interaction between me and a marmot. Being alone affords you a closer interaction with nature. Almost everyday I would come within 10 feet of deer who would gaze at me with mild surprise, but without fear, who would simply continue munching on grass as though I wasn’t even there. On that fated day I was heading back to Rock Creek. I heard a loud screech and looked to my right to see a marmot sitting upon a rock staring at me. Intrigued, I walked closer and he quickly dashed away. With a sigh I was about to continue onwards when I saw him poke his head out of a hole five feet away from me. Thus began my conversation with the marmot.</p>

<p>Me: Why hello there marmot. How are you?</p>

<p>Marmot: <em>Sticks head out a little more</em></p>

<p>Me: I am well, a bit sore but what can you do?</p>

<p>Marmot: <em>Stares</em></p>

<p>Me: <em>Proceeds to take 20 photos</em> Thank you for your time, I really appreciate you coming out like this. <em>Bows to Marmot, and takes a step away</em></p>

<p>Marmot: <em>Disappears down the marmot hole</em></p>

<p>So yeah, I had a conversation with a marmot. I regret nothing, it was fantastic, and wonderfully intimate. That is the benefit of backpacking alone.</p>

<h4 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Pack super light for climbing Whitney, if possible bring a light day pack to really shed the pounds. That does not mean skimping on water, bring lots of water</li>
  <li>Acclimate or plan a super short day whenever you are planning to go above 10,000 ft of elevation</li>
  <li>Leave for Whitney really early in the day. Ideally leave from Guitar Lake if camping there is available.</li>
  <li>You don’t need a WAG bag while climbing up the backside!!!!</li>
  <li>I lose my appetite at elevation, if you split up eating into bites over the course of the day you can still stomach foods. So unless you know how elevation affects you, don’t plan on having large meals that won’t travel.</li>
  <li>The road to the cottonwood pass trailhead is very windy and I would never want to drive it at night</li>
</ol>
