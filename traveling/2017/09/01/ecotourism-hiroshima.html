    <h2>Ecotourism in Hiroshima Prefecture</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">September 01, 2017</p>
    
    <p>During the summer of 2017, I decided to volunteer with my boyfriend at the Peace Culture Village (PCV), a “nonprofit, international eco-village and experiential peace training camp” located in the countryside of Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan. Although I have been learning Japanese since I can remember, I did not have much experience speaking Japanese in a non-academic setting so needless to say I was a little nervous about finding my way around Japan.</p>

<p>Immediately after arriving at Kansai International Airport (KIX) in Osaka, I had to get us to Hiroshima to meet Steve, the founder of PCV, who would be picking us up from Hiroshima station in a few hours. The second we stepped out of the airport, we were hit with a cloud of hot humid air unlike any other. I immediately questioned my decisions knowing we would likely not have the luxury of air conditioning out in the countryside.</p>

<p>We made our way under a misty walkway towards the ticketing area. I took in a deep breath and tried to remember all my years of Japanese education as I walked over to ask the attendant about buying train tickets to Hiroshima. I guess my education paid off because we were immediately directed to the Shinkansen (bullet-train) booking room inside.</p>

<p>Finally, we found ourselves sitting on the Shinkansen to Hiroshima.</p>

<p>We spent the first couple of days in the city where Steve, also a translator and peace activist, took us on a personal tour of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. I had mixed feelings when I learned they took out the most impactful part of the museum, melting wax figures in a fiery hell scape depicting the horrors of (nuclear) war. When I visited with museum as a third grader, it terrified me. I felt a mixture of sadness and horror for the rest of the day but now, years later, it is one of the few parts that left a lasting impression on me.</p>

<hr />

<p>We took a two hour bus ride from Hiroshima city to Miyoshi city, both in Hiroshima prefecture. By the time we arrived in Konu cho, a town within Miyoshi, it was dark. Two PCV staff members came to drive us up the long and windy road to the village. It was pitch black outside so I could only imagine what the surroundings looked like. When we stepped out of the car, our ears were hit with a cacophony of frogs and insects. I could not wait until daylight to see the area which sounded like a dense tropical jungle.</p>

<p>All staff members and visitors alike are expected to rise and start work on the farm at 7am every weekday before breakfast. Our first day on the farm was no exception. Still half-expecting a tropical jungle, I hurriedly opened the curtains to look out at the farm below. To my surprise there were no infinite rows of crops like the ones I’d see traveling through the Central California Valley, but what appeared to be an expansive garden in the midst of a lusciously green landscape. So began my introduction to permaculture.</p>

<p>As I soon learned, permaculture principles encapsulate the idea of working with your environment, rather than against it. One of our first tasks as volunteers was to help with weeding. The frequent rains means weeds grow very tall, very quickly. Instead of pulling weeds up roots and all, we were taught to shave the weeds from the ground with a sickle as not to disturb the soil structure underneath. Growing up in a family of gardeners, the idea of leaving roots behind was unheard of. The more large nests of shaved weeds we made around the base of each soybean plant, the more I came to appreciate this method. The nests would brown after a few days and begin its disintegration process into topsoil all while protecting the plant from losing too much moisture.</p>

<p>We spent most of our time helping with various repairs and building projects, taking turns preparing the communal meals with freshly harvested produce, and meeting other visitors from around the world. We were surrounded by vibrant green mountains, crisp clean air, fresh vegetables, two farm cats, tiny frogs and friendly people. It is no surprise it was hard to say goodbye.</p>

<p>We decided to spend 3 days sightseeing on the way back to Kansai International Airport. We chose Kyoto for its fame, Nara for its deer and Osaka for convenience. I was able to find Air BnB’s a short distance from the train stations, most within walking distance. I opted to not get a pocket wifi and instead rely on Google Map screenshots and asking for directions. If you are comfortable enough with speaking and understanding Japanese, I find a pocket wifi is not necessary. Every Air BnB we went to had a pocket wifi we could take with us, but since we only stayed one night in each city we never took it outside.</p>

<h3 id="kyoto">Kyoto</h3>

<p>We arrived in Kyoto late at night, finding vegetarian food for Sean was especially a challenge this time. We found places with vegetarian options on Yelp but even though the hours said they were open, the restaurant was closed when we arrived. We ended up picking up some things to eat from 7-11. In the morning, we had another 7-11 breakfast before dropping our luggage at the coin lockers and heading to the popular Fushimi Inari Taisha. It was especially crowded around 10am and not the peaceful experience I was expecting. We ended up taking a smaller trail up to the top, an option I highly recommend to get away from all the Instagram photoshoots. We ended up weaving along bamboo groves and discovering various shrines along on our ascent and saw only a handful of people the entire time. We descended from the top down the main route under the red <em>torii</em>. It was much less crowded after lunchtime.</p>

<h3 id="nara">Nara</h3>

<p>After Kyoto, we hopped on the train to Nara. We were both incredibly tired by the time we reached the Air BnB and ended up watching some Japanese TV on a 12 inch screen. When it came time for dinner it happened again, we walked nearly a mile to a vegetarian-serving restaurant but they were mysteriously closed. Don’t trust hours on Yelp in Japan. At least we found a particularly good drink from the vending machine on the way back. For some strange reason, no other vending machine we checked had this coveted <em>Mix Fruits Au Lait</em>.</p>

<p>In the morning, we stopped for breakfast at Little Mermaid Bakery. We had some cheese bread which ended up being the most delicious pizza we ever ate in Japan. Pizza and peanut butter were essentially impossible to find, at least out in the countryside. We continued our walk to Nara Koen (Nara Park) where we were swarmed by deer looking for <em>shika senbei</em>, or deer crackers. One of the deer pierced a hole in my backpack as I was feeding another deer, I was ready to leave after that.</p>

<p>We made a stop at <em>Isui-en</em>, a Japanese garden, on the way to Todaiji, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which houses the <em>Daibutsu</em> (The Great Buddha) in the main hall.</p>

<h3 id="osaka">Osaka</h3>

<p>After a long hot day in Nara, we arrived in Osaka before sunset. Sean found a vegan restaurant, <em>Shizen Bar Paprika Shokudou Vegan</em>, a mile away from the Air BnB and this time they were open! I ordered the vegan <em>karaage</em> and was pleasantly surprised. On our way back we saw some lanterns in the distance and we ended up discovering <em>Dotonbori</em>. I hardly did any research on Osaka since it was just where the airport was located but this actually turned out to be the most exciting city we visited. The neon lights dancing on the canal, the oversized model food, and the seemingly endless life. We won a few things from the claw machines in an arcade and discovered <em>Don Quijote</em>, a store which sells everything and feels like an amusement park. There were about nine floors in <em>Don Quijote</em>, floor a different category. Think of it as a dollar store fused with a department store. Two seemingly polar opposites mashed into one. With my senses sufficiently overloaded, I was ready to leave Osaka and Japan.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>

<p><strong>Biggest Takeaways</strong></p>

<p>Next time I would avoid the touristy destinations or read in depth about the history of famous sites beforehand. Mixing up cities and historic sites and avoiding mid-day heat during the summer will be key to your enjoyment.</p>

<p>The best parts of the trip did not involve any planning aside from lodging.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Visit</strong></p>

<p>The Kansai region is a great place to explore if you only have a few days. Big attractions are very close, an hour or less apart and inexpensive to travel to and from.</p>

<p><strong>Getting Around on a Budget</strong></p>

<p>If you are planning a budget trip to Japan, avoid riding the <em>shinkansen</em> as much as possible. Buses are typically the cheapest way to get around.</p>

<p>When booking lodging, consider distance from the station. You may need to factor in taxi costs.</p>

<p><strong>Vegetarian</strong></p>

<p>Being a vegetarian in Japan is incredibly difficult and frankly a bit depressing. Japanese cuisine often uses <em>dashi</em> which is typically made using <em>bonito</em> fish flakes. There may be fish or meat in places you least expect it. I once bought a slice of cheese pizza with nori on top only to discover a layer of cooked salmon underneath the cheese. At convenience stores, salads often have ham or some kind of meat on top. In restaurants, often times the only “safe” foods for strict vegetarians will be plain rice and seaweed. Larger cities will usually have more options for vegetarians.</p>

<p><strong>Pocket Wifi</strong></p>

<p>Unless you are confident enough in your Japanese, get a pocket wifi. Some air bnbs’ provide pocket wifis but obviously getting to the next location will be difficult without your own. If you really want to avoid purchasing pocket wifi like I did, you can take dozens of detailed screenshots of Google Maps. (Note: offline maps do not seem to be available in many parts of Japan.) Download all offline maps you need before getting to Japan, there’s a handy app call maps.me which is extremely useful.</p>

<p><strong>Cash &amp; ATM’s</strong></p>

<p>Cash is still king in Japan. 7-11’s and other larger chains have ATM’s you can use to withdraw cash. Be sure to let your bank know when you will be out of the country to avoid any problems.</p>
