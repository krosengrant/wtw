    <h2>Kyoto</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">April 08, 2019</p>
    
    <p>Kyoto is a very touristy city filled with what seems like an endless supply of temples. The temples tend to blur together, with a single exception, Kokedera, a moss temple. While planning our trip this is one of the few places I insisted we go, I have always loved moss, and a temple cultivating the beauty of moss seemed like a dream world. So immediately after purchasing our plane tickets we sent in a reservation by mail to the temple, or rather Hirari did unbeknownst to Katie and me. (The request to visit the temple must be sent in advance and from an address in Japan).</p>

<p>To get to the temple, we took a local bus line from Kyoto up a mountain road along an impressive river. Along the way we stopped at a shopping area, filled with all variety of Kyoto specials, in particular an abundance of yatsuhashi.</p>

<p>From there, we took a much smaller bus across the river and up a narrow winding road, all the way to the final bus stop.We continued on foot until we reached a small stone bridge crossing a creek bed. Upon entering the gates, we were quickly herded with a group of other tourists through a mossless courtyard, to a small outdoor shelter connected to the temple. We removed our shoes, and headed into the temple, where the murmur of talk abruptly cut off as people respectfully silenced.</p>

<p>We were led into a room with rows of low tables, with two copies of the sutra sitting on top with an inkwell and a calligraphy brush. The interior of the temple was symmetrical with rows of low tables facing inwards into the empty space in the center of the room in front of a large alcove, from which an ornate statue looked out. Each table had a simple arrangement, a thin cushion to sit upon, and atop the table an inkwell and calligraphy brush with thick bristles. The items we would read to copy a portion of the sutra. Luckily, we had finer brushes we had brought. Hirari, always the forward thinker had made us buy some the day before, much to my objection of spending unnecessary money. So when we sat down seiza in front of the low desks, I wordlessly held out my hand to accept the thinner brush from Hirari. We immediately began are grueling tracing of an outlined sutra while sitting in seiza, while a buddhist monk chanted. I would like to say that I reached a deep meditative state as I wordlessly copied the kanjis, and became lost in the monk’s steady melodic chant. However, despite my best efforts I was unable to ignore my worldly pains, largely the discomfort in sitting seiza. Within, five minutes it was taking all of my willpower to maintain my position as I glared at the seemingly never ending columns of kanjis.</p>

<p>Soon the monks began releasing people, wordlessly taking their papers and directing them to the gardens. Now, I’m not proud of this, but every time someone left the room with their unfinished sutra, I vehemently glared, annoyed that the monks had allowed them to leave with an uncompleted sutra. I was left in desperation, my legs ached and I wanted to be done. Slowly my kanji had become sloppier and sloppier, albeit slightly more natural and confident looking, as my pain had grown. Yet in retrospect, and a college psychology course later, I can’t help but wonder if perhaps that discomfort and pain made the experience what it was, a majestic world of moss.</p>

<p>So in the end, as most people would say, all the pain and discomfort leading up to the experience was completely worth it. We wandered through moss filled gardens, by ponds and lakes, across bridges traversing neatly lined streams of the clearest water. Up and around small mountain paths surrounded by comforting shades of green, all the while immersed in a fresh smelling world, as sprinkles of water brought our skin to life with little pricks. It was a world in of itself, becoming more detailed with every step, every pause we took was delighted with an unceasing source of detail. Too soon my body once again rebelled, this time with hunger, and we left the compound desperate for food. I was left with a feeling of distance, where the mind is somewhere up in the clouds tethered to the body by the thinnest of threads, the most tumultuous connection. Soon the rich smells of food, and the cold of the rain cemented the connection and the feelings faded.</p>
