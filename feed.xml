I was going to climb Mt. Whitney during a five-day trip through the High Sierras. It was the most mentally and physically difficult trip I have ever done. I planned to hike ~12 miles into Rock Creek through Cottonwood Pass on the first day, the next day ~7 miles to Guitar Lake, and on the third day I would summit Mt.Whitney and return to Guitar Lake. My last two days I would hike out to Rock Creek, and then all the way out of Cottonwood Pass. It was a fantastic plan. I still stand by it. It would have split the distances up perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one small problem, elevation. The morning of September 22nd I woke up at 4am from my home in LA and drove three hours to the Eastern Interagency Center to get a five-day walk-in permit for Cottonwood Pass. By 9am I had the pass in hand and had already ascended ~9,000 ft on a narrow winding road to the base of the Cottonwood Pass Trail. By 11am I was at Chicken Spring Lake (~11,200 ft) refilling water. That was as far as I got. I tried to keep going, but all of a sudden I was hit by fatigue, every step left me out breath and my head swirling. Realizing I could go no further I painstakingly began setting up camp. Every step exhausted me as preparations stretched themselves over a couple of hours. Wearily I forced myself to eat a couple of bites before cuddling up in my sleeping bag to a fitful night of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning I woke up tired but not light-headed. Where the night before a couple of steps would leave me out of breath, now I could walk at least 100 ft and only be panting slightly. I mention this for one crucial point, ALLOW TIME FOR ACCLIMATION. Some small little version of me was still determined to get to the top of Mt. Whitney, so with a small sigh I decided to hike to Crabtree from Chicken Spring, a distance of approximately ~15 miles. It was a hard day filled with constant elevation change, and barely any flat. On the way I ran into two rangers, one of which who asked for my full name, leaving me with a sick feeling that she surely thought I was going to die. (I realize this is just a safety thing, but at the time it scared me) I arrived just after dark at lower Crabtree and began plotting my Whitney ascent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the morning of the 24th at 8am I began the path to Whitney. People who say it is easy are either in phenomenal shape or are simply lying. Every step I took after Guitar Lake on those 11 switchbacks was hell. I had already spent hours walking up hill to simply get to that point and was quite done going up, but I still had ~2,500 ft of vertical elevation to gain. I honestly don’t know where I found the willpower to keep going. Every time I stopped to catch my breath I told myself it would be okay to just turn around, but some part of me kept pushing, it told me I didn’t have to quit. I knew no one, including myself, would be disappointed if I had to turn around, and yet I kept going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 3:30 pm I finally saw the hut at the top. I somehow found the energy to smile as I forced my feet through the final couple hundred feet. At the hut I dropped my bag and looked at the uninterrupted views from every side. The site is something that cannot be captured by photos, or at least not my photos. There is sort of a delirious excitement to being at the very top. I couldn’t help but smile to myself as I climbed on top of a rock and thought to myself that I am higher than every other person on land in the U.S. Going down, I flew, every step was easy as I smiled at my own accomplishments, even with my speed I arrived at my campsite after nightfall, again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, I slept in. When I woke I felt as though my body had been beaten with a bag of bricks and then dragged behind a truck. Slowly and with a heaping plateful of pain I packed up camp and made my way to Rock Creek. Up until this point I have not addressed what it is like being alone in the wilderness. For each person I am sure it is drastically different. For me, my perception of it varied vastly with the time of day. In the mornings I woke up peaceful and content, in awe of the beauty and sounds that surrounded me. Around sunset the loneliness and silence would always hit me for an hour or so, my mind would leap into overdrive analyzing all the things that could possibly go wrong. After my panic, I was always left with a feeling of acceptance, that I was simply adrift in the world and should not worry about my place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mention this for one reason only, an interaction between me and a marmot. Being alone affords you a closer interaction with nature. Almost everyday I would come within 10 feet of deer who would gaze at me with mild surprise, but without fear, who would simply continue munching on grass as though I wasn’t even there. On that fated day I was heading back to Rock Creek. I heard a loud screech and looked to my right to see a marmot sitting upon a rock staring at me. Intrigued, I walked closer and he quickly dashed away. With a sigh I was about to continue onwards when I saw him poke his head out of a hole five feet away from me. Thus began my conversation with the marmot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Why hello there marmot. How are you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marmot: &lt;em&gt;Sticks head out a little more&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I am well, a bit sore but what can you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marmot: &lt;em&gt;Stares&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: &lt;em&gt;Proceeds to take 20 photos&lt;/em&gt; Thank you for your time, I really appreciate you coming out like this. &lt;em&gt;Bows to Marmot, and takes a step away&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marmot: &lt;em&gt;Disappears down the marmot hole&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I had a conversation with a marmot. I regret nothing, it was fantastic, and wonderfully intimate. That is the benefit of backpacking alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I learned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pack super light for climbing Whitney, if possible bring a light day pack to really shed the pounds. That does not mean skimping on water, bring lots of water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acclimate or plan a super short day whenever you are planning to go above 10,000 ft of elevation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leave for Whitney really early in the day. Ideally leave from Guitar Lake if camping there is available.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don’t need a WAG bag while climbing up the backside!!!!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I lose my appetite at elevation, if you split up eating into bites over the course of the day you can still stomach foods. So unless you know how elevation affects you, don’t plan on having large meals that won’t travel.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The road to the cottonwood pass trailhead is very windy and I would never want to drive it at night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;distances&quot;&gt;Distances&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cottonwood Pass Trailhead to Chicken Spring – ~4 miles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chicken Spring to Lower Crab Tree – ~16 miles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lower Crab Tree to Whitney (x2 for the way back)- ~ 8 miles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lower Crab Tree to Rock Creek- ~8 miles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rock Creek to Cottonwood Pass Trailhead – ~12 miles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Round Trip – ~52 miles&lt;/p&gt;

The temples tend to blur together, with a single exception, Kokedera, a moss temple. While planning our trip this is one of the few places I insisted we go, I have always loved moss, and a temple cultivating the beauty of moss seemed like a dream world. So immediately after purchasing our plane tickets we sent in a reservation by mail to the temple, or rather Hirari did unbeknownst to Katie and me. (The request to visit the temple must be sent in advance and from an address in Japan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get to the temple, we took a local bus line from Kyoto up a mountain road along an impressive river. Along the way we stopped at a shopping area, filled with all variety of Kyoto specials, in particular an abundance of yatsuhashi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, we took a much smaller bus across the river and up a narrow winding road, all the way to the final bus stop.We continued on foot until we reached a small stone bridge crossing a creek bed. Upon entering the gates, we were quickly herded with a group of other tourists through a mossless courtyard, to a small outdoor shelter connected to the temple. We removed our shoes, and headed into the temple, where the murmur of talk abruptly cut off as people respectfully silenced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were led into a room with rows of low tables, with two copies of the sutra sitting on top with an inkwell and a calligraphy brush. The interior of the temple was symmetrical with rows of low tables facing inwards into the empty space in the center of the room in front of a large alcove, from which an ornate statue looked out. Each table had a simple arrangement, a thin cushion to sit upon, and atop the table an inkwell and calligraphy brush with thick bristles. The items we would read to copy a portion of the sutra. Luckily, we had finer brushes we had brought. Hirari, always the forward thinker had made us buy some the day before, much to my objection of spending unnecessary money. So when we sat down seiza in front of the low desks, I wordlessly held out my hand to accept the thinner brush from Hirari. We immediately began are grueling tracing of an outlined sutra while sitting in seiza, while a buddhist monk chanted. I would like to say that I reached a deep meditative state as I wordlessly copied the kanjis, and became lost in the monk’s steady melodic chant. However, despite my best efforts I was unable to ignore my worldly pains, largely the discomfort in sitting seiza. Within, five minutes it was taking all of my willpower to maintain my position as I glared at the seemingly never ending columns of kanjis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon the monks began releasing people, wordlessly taking their papers and directing them to the gardens. Now, I’m not proud of this, but every time someone left the room with their unfinished sutra, I vehemently glared, annoyed that the monks had allowed them to leave with an uncompleted sutra. I was left in desperation, my legs ached and I wanted to be done. Slowly my kanji had become sloppier and sloppier, albeit slightly more natural and confident looking, as my pain had grown. Yet in retrospect, and a college psychology course later, I can’t help but wonder if perhaps that discomfort and pain made the experience what it was, a majestic world of moss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the end, as most people would say, all the pain and discomfort leading up to the experience was completely worth it. We wandered through moss filled gardens, by ponds and lakes, across bridges traversing neatly lined streams of the clearest water. Up and around small mountain paths surrounded by comforting shades of green, all the while immersed in a fresh smelling world, as sprinkles of water brought our skin to life with little pricks. It was a world in of itself, becoming more detailed with every step, every pause we took was delighted with an unceasing source of detail. Too soon my body once again rebelled, this time with hunger, and we left the compound desperate for food. I was left with a feeling of distance, where the mind is somewhere up in the clouds tethered to the body by the thinnest of threads, the most tumultuous connection. Soon the rich smells of food, and the cold of the rain cemented the connection and the feelings faded.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="traveling" /><category term="asia" /><category term="japan" /><category term="kyoto" /><summary type="html">Kyoto is a very touristy city filled with what seems like an endless supply of temples.

Still facing the ground I clipped the waist strap and pulled, feeling it tighten and the weight settle on my hips as I stood. With a shiver, I looked around the familiar parking lot, that we had visited many times over the years. It was colder than it had ever been, it was our first time coming in the winter, and we were expecting bad weather. With one last look at the car, which too had been upgraded from our first trip, we set off along the familiar trail, that differed only in the glittering frost covering the plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all began around four years ago, I had just gotten my driver’s license so naturally, my friends and I packed up to go on our first parent-free backpacking trip. This was the first of many trips that we would take into the Sespe Wilderness. Our first trip was a three-day weekend in the spring, with four overpacked and nervous teenage girls. Even though it was spring, the temperatures soared and we found ourselves hating the seemingly never-ending series of ups and downs. On the trail, we only passed a few groups but did see a pack of boy scouts scurrying around in a little valley around halfway to Willett.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time we did this trip we didn’t even make it to Willett Campground and ended up settling at Oak Flat for the first night. The next day, we left our camp and continued on in the hopes of finding Willett’s hot tub for a quick day soak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest way to find Willett Hot Tub is to follow the main trail and wait for a sharp right down a decently steep short incline to a very shallow and wide river crossing. After crossing the river one should continue along the trail for about 5 minutes and then turn left down a well traveled incline that splits off from the main trail. Here one must cross the river bed and continue straight towards the mountains. At the very base of the mountains there is a cabin and a group of shacks next to an open horse pasture. In front of these cabins you will find a trail running along the base of the mountains, following this trail will lead up the mountain to the Willett Hot Spring tub. In recent years, the trail up to the hot tub has become increasingly sketchy. At points the ground consists of a thin layer of slippery gravel, over hard packed dirt with a near sheer drop off on one side, and on the other side loose dirt with nothing to grip onto. (Keep in mind going down will be worse than going up) At the top of the hill there will be a small flat clearing, where people sometimes camp, right before a clump of trees and brush. To find the tub, one must go straight into the brush, and follow the water uphill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In future trips, we were able to make it to Willett in 1 day, roughly 14 miles, and were even lucky enough to stay in the cabin for a night. And yet we were never able to make it all the way to Sespe Hot Springs. We had always turned back too soon, once even stopping right before the last uphill before the trail division, giving up before seeing the old rusted sign pointing to Sespe. Regardless, this winter, more than four years after our first trip we finally made it all the way to Sespe Hot Springs. There we bathed in the warm stream under the starlight, exhausted but extremely pleased with ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned from all of our old mistakes and gave ourselves four days rather than the usual three to more comfortably travel the distance. The first night was the hardest, the entire night it rained while we huddled together in one of the old shacks at Willett listening to the rain hit the corrugated steel and the wind shake the structure late into the night. The next day the clouds cleared and we continued on to Sespe where we relaxed and melted off the fatigue from the miles logged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of four days, we left the wilderness relaxed, covered in the mud and ready to face the new year. Perhaps it was the fact we had failed so many times, or perhaps it was the company, the chance to reconnect with old high school friends, but overall we were left with feelings of excitement and energy that overshadowed the deep exhaustion of our muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-few-noteworthy-tidbits&quot;&gt;A few noteworthy tidbits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiking in the summer is miserable, endless up and downs in the burning heat, and a constant desire to stop at any available water source and lay down in the shade. The winter faces its own issues, unpredictable weather and a constant cold. And yet, the winter is so much better, albeit more crowded, the warmth of Willett and Sespe gently pull you away from the cold and offer a reprieve that though it only lasts for less than an hour, feels longer than the time spent agonizing with every step. In addition, dogs are welcome on the trail, and many groups are accompanied with furry companions, some even with their own pack. On one occasion Raven, my black lab, joined us on an excursion and ended the trip with beat up paws, so if traveling with a dog I would suggest either going in the winter or buying your dog some shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;distances&quot;&gt;Distances&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Piedra Blanca Trailhead to Willett – 9.6 miles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Willett to Sespe Hot Springs – 5.6 miles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total One Way – 15.2 miles&lt;/p&gt;

We weren’t sure what to expect and were prepared for crowds, trash, and camping on BLM (land outside of the park where camping is permitted). None of these stressors were encountered. Outside of campsites there were few people, the trash and toilets were well taken care of, and we were even lucky enough to stumble across an open campsite at Ryan Campground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the weekend hiking to boulders and attempting to climb them. For all but one of us it was our first time climbing outside of a gym and it wasn’t at all what we expected. Despite the problems being of a much lower height we were intimidated by the rough texture of the rocks and the seemingly high consequences of falling against a substrate that felt like a cheese grater. Not only were the holds smaller but the footholds were often just little nubs or cracks along the rock surface. We had been majorly babied by the gyms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halfway through the trip we learned that an outdoor V0 was equivalent to an indoor V3 or V4… Oops. With that in mind we began tackling sub V0’s to build up our confidence and by the end of the trip approached the V0’s with more knowledge and confidence. Though we were largely defeated by many routes we got a taste of outdoor climbing and will certainly be back for more.&lt;/p&gt;

(I quote adult, because now in college, my view of what it means to be an adult has completely changed) At this point in our lives, I think we almost needed to prove that we could function independently and survive in a foreign environment.

&lt;p&gt;Given our inexperience we devoted an extreme amount of time to research and planning, some of which paid off and others parts seemed excessive. On the bright side our intensive planning, is very helpful in providing cost estimates and travel information for anyone interested in traveling throughout Japan. For this trip we decided to have a home base, rather than packing light, where we stayed in Hirari’s grandfathers house in Nagoya and took all of our multi-day trips from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We traveled to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kyoto&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mt. Fuji&lt;/li&gt;

The rocks emerge from the ground at unnatural angles, like books leaning in a row, creating complex rock formations that are quite easy for anyone to ascend. It makes the perfect day trip out of LA, and is relatively empty, at least during winter. Katie and I visited Vasquez rocks just before Christmas immediately after a rainstorm and were able to witness dramatic clouds pushed around by chilling winds as we scrambled up the rocky terrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to other places with climbable rocks, Vasquez Rocks is not only easier to climb/hike, but are also finer grain, meaning that, worst case scenario, one can climb the most recognizable rock formation barefoot, as Katie did, which she highly recommends. Otherwise, it is a prudent idea to bring shoes with a good grip to aid in ascending steep inclines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about Vasquez Rocks is it is accessible, even to the most budget conscious college students, as the park itself has no entry fee yet has similar facilities to that of a National Park. The visitors center’s walls are lined with maps and small glass enclosures with a small variety of local animals. Inside, park rangers are available for any questions or trail recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the wide variety of hiking trails, a portion of the PCT also runs through the park, providing the opportunity to walk just a tiny portion of the 2,650 mile trail. Of the hiking trails, there are trails for both pedestrians and equestrians. There is also the less expensive and legal option of participating in day horseback riding programs in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unique landscape not only allows for a fun hiking experience, but also dramatic photographs (according to Katie, all of my photographs were subpar). This unique landscape has in turn made Vasquez rocks a prominent filming location where notable TV Shows and Movies, such as Star Trek and Austin Powers, have been filmed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="hiking" /><category term="outdoor" /><summary type="html">An ethereal landscape fitting of another planet Vasquez Rocks is only an hour outside of LA but seems like a different world.

We had two very different ideas for the trip. I wanted to go as far as possible to get away from the crowds and Katie wanted to get acclimated to killer elevation. My plan disintegrated within a mile and it was decided we would go to Muir Lake for the first night, initiating the more camp time less hike time protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest the idea for this trip originated from a photo on Instagram. A photo of a young white husky, smiling amongst tall yellow grass with a dark blue lake framing its head. This photo inspired two thoughts: 1) Memories of hiking with my dog when she was younger and 2) the desire to go where this husky had been. So I wasn’t left with much of a choice. I needed to visit Cottonwood Lakes before the snow fell, less I disappoint a very cheery and inspirational Husky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second night was spent at a lake below the pass and above the tree-line amongst the marmots. We followed their example and perched ourselves atop the rocks to watch the minute changes in scenery, the deep blue of sky slowly transitioned into a pink that filled the lake waters reflecting the sky and mountain peeks. The breeze would come through stirring the lake water into movement, briefly distorting the mountain and sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we hiked through New Army Pass accompanied by the familiar feeling of walking up endless switchbacks while staying stationary. As we inched higher we passed through spires of rocks towering over the trail, a small reminder of the San Andres fault running through California. To the left and to the right the mountain peaks spread out in a semi circle, the reddish white rock cutting sharply into the empty air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top we snacked on salami, flat bread, and nuts before turning away from Cottonwood Lakes and following the gently sloping path down towards a grass filled plateau. The path wound through the grass where it divided, one path continued downwards, and the other continued up towards Mt. Langley (for those peak baggers out there). Naturally, after all the uphill we followed the downhill path heading towards Soldier Lake. The path continued along the plateau before dropping steeply into another series of switchbacks towards a dried up river bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our walk continued throughout continually changing terrain, through empty rocks, flowing streams, towering pines until we stopped for the night at a small lake we thought would be pretty empty. Instead, we ended up surrounded by other groups. It was odd that the most remote place (farthest from the trailhead) was the most inhabited rather than our previous camps where we were mostly secluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we headed back over the pass amidst intense winds. With every step the wind would rock us side to side pushing us off balance. By the time we reached Long Lake and the trees were bending over with the force we had come to the decision to head back a day early rather than camp amidst the high winds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mileage-breakdown&quot;&gt;Mileage Breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trailhead to Muir Lake — 5 miles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muir Lake to Long Lake — 2 miles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long Lake to Soldier Lake via New Army Pass — 6 miles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soldier Lake to Trailhead — 11 miles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;meal-plan&quot;&gt;Meal Plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up favoring on-the-go meals over cooking and washing dishes. The Trader Joe’s Columbus Salame Secchi (salami) was a favorite from the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

Although I have been learning Japanese since I can remember, I did not have much experience speaking Japanese in a non-academic setting so needless to say I was a little nervous about finding my way around Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately after arriving at Kansai International Airport (KIX) in Osaka, I had to get us to Hiroshima to meet Steve, the founder of PCV, who would be picking us up from Hiroshima station in a few hours. The second we stepped out of the airport, we were hit with a cloud of hot humid air unlike any other. I immediately questioned my decisions knowing we would likely not have the luxury of air conditioning out in the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made our way under a misty walkway towards the ticketing area. I took in a deep breath and tried to remember all my years of Japanese education as I walked over to ask the attendant about buying train tickets to Hiroshima. I guess my education paid off because we were immediately directed to the Shinkansen (bullet-train) booking room inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we found ourselves sitting on the Shinkansen to Hiroshima.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the first couple of days in the city where Steve, also a translator and peace activist, took us on a personal tour of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. I had mixed feelings when I learned they took out the most impactful part of the museum, melting wax figures in a fiery hell scape depicting the horrors of (nuclear) war. When I visited with museum as a third grader, it terrified me. I felt a mixture of sadness and horror for the rest of the day but now, years later, it is one of the few parts that left a lasting impression on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took a two hour bus ride from Hiroshima city to Miyoshi city, both in Hiroshima prefecture. By the time we arrived in Konu cho, a town within Miyoshi, it was dark. Two PCV staff members came to drive us up the long and windy road to the village. It was pitch black outside so I could only imagine what the surroundings looked like. When we stepped out of the car, our ears were hit with a cacophony of frogs and insects. I could not wait until daylight to see the area which sounded like a dense tropical jungle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All staff members and visitors alike are expected to rise and start work on the farm at 7am every weekday before breakfast. Our first day on the farm was no exception. Still half-expecting a tropical jungle, I hurriedly opened the curtains to look out at the farm below. To my surprise there were no infinite rows of crops like the ones I’d see traveling through the Central California Valley, but what appeared to be an expansive garden in the midst of a lusciously green landscape. So began my introduction to permaculture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I soon learned, permaculture principles encapsulate the idea of working with your environment, rather than against it. One of our first tasks as volunteers was to help with weeding. The frequent rains means weeds grow very tall, very quickly. Instead of pulling weeds up roots and all, we were taught to shave the weeds from the ground with a sickle as not to disturb the soil structure underneath. Growing up in a family of gardeners, the idea of leaving roots behind was unheard of. The more large nests of shaved weeds we made around the base of each soybean plant, the more I came to appreciate this method. The nests would brown after a few days and begin its disintegration process into topsoil all while protecting the plant from losing too much moisture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent most of our time helping with various repairs and building projects, taking turns preparing the communal meals with freshly harvested produce, and meeting other visitors from around the world. We were surrounded by vibrant green mountains, crisp clean air, fresh vegetables, two farm cats, tiny frogs and friendly people. It is no surprise it was hard to say goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to spend 3 days sightseeing on the way back to Kansai International Airport. We chose Kyoto for its fame, Nara for its deer and Osaka for convenience. I was able to find Air BnB’s a short distance from the train stations, most within walking distance. I opted to not get a pocket wifi and instead rely on Google Map screenshots and asking for directions. If you are comfortable enough with speaking and understanding Japanese, I find a pocket wifi is not necessary. Every Air BnB we went to had a pocket wifi we could take with us, but since we only stayed one night in each city we never took it outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kyoto&quot;&gt;Kyoto&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Kyoto late at night, finding vegetarian food for Sean was especially a challenge this time. We found places with vegetarian options on Yelp but even though the hours said they were open, the restaurant was closed when we arrived. We ended up picking up some things to eat from 7-11. In the morning, we had another 7-11 breakfast before dropping our luggage at the coin lockers and heading to the popular Fushimi Inari Taisha. It was especially crowded around 10am and not the peaceful experience I was expecting. We ended up taking a smaller trail up to the top, an option I highly recommend to get away from all the Instagram photoshoots. We ended up weaving along bamboo groves and discovering various shrines along on our ascent and saw only a handful of people the entire time. We descended from the top down the main route under the red &lt;em&gt;torii&lt;/em&gt;. It was much less crowded after lunchtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nara&quot;&gt;Nara&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Kyoto, we hopped on the train to Nara. We were both incredibly tired by the time we reached the Air BnB and ended up watching some Japanese TV on a 12 inch screen. When it came time for dinner it happened again, we walked nearly a mile to a vegetarian-serving restaurant but they were mysteriously closed. Don’t trust hours on Yelp in Japan. At least we found a particularly good drink from the vending machine on the way back. For some strange reason, no other vending machine we checked had this coveted &lt;em&gt;Mix Fruits Au Lait&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning, we stopped for breakfast at Little Mermaid Bakery. We had some cheese bread which ended up being the most delicious pizza we ever ate in Japan. Pizza and peanut butter were essentially impossible to find, at least out in the countryside. We continued our walk to Nara Koen (Nara Park) where we were swarmed by deer looking for &lt;em&gt;shika senbei&lt;/em&gt;, or deer crackers. One of the deer pierced a hole in my backpack as I was feeding another deer, I was ready to leave after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made a stop at &lt;em&gt;Isui-en&lt;/em&gt;, a Japanese garden, on the way to Todaiji, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which houses the &lt;em&gt;Daibutsu&lt;/em&gt; (The Great Buddha) in the main hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;osaka&quot;&gt;Osaka&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long hot day in Nara, we arrived in Osaka before sunset. Sean found a vegan restaurant, &lt;em&gt;Shizen Bar Paprika Shokudou Vegan&lt;/em&gt;, a mile away from the Air BnB and this time they were open! I ordered the vegan &lt;em&gt;karaage&lt;/em&gt; and was pleasantly surprised. On our way back we saw some lanterns in the distance and we ended up discovering &lt;em&gt;Dotonbori&lt;/em&gt;. I hardly did any research on Osaka since it was just where the airport was located but this actually turned out to be the most exciting city we visited. The neon lights dancing on the canal, the oversized model food, and the seemingly endless life. We won a few things from the claw machines in an arcade and discovered &lt;em&gt;Don Quijote&lt;/em&gt;, a store which sells everything and feels like an amusement park. There were about nine floors in &lt;em&gt;Don Quijote&lt;/em&gt;, floor a different category. Think of it as a dollar store fused with a department store. Two seemingly polar opposites mashed into one. With my senses sufficiently overloaded, I was ready to leave Osaka and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biggest Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time I would avoid the touristy destinations or read in depth about the history of famous sites beforehand. Mixing up cities and historic sites and avoiding mid-day heat during the summer will be key to your enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best parts of the trip did not involve any planning aside from lodging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to Visit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kansai region is a great place to explore if you only have a few days. Big attractions are very close, an hour or less apart and inexpensive to travel to and from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Around on a Budget&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are planning a budget trip to Japan, avoid riding the &lt;em&gt;shinkansen&lt;/em&gt; as much as possible. Buses are typically the cheapest way to get around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When booking lodging, consider distance from the station. You may need to factor in taxi costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vegetarian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a vegetarian in Japan is incredibly difficult and frankly a bit depressing. Japanese cuisine often uses &lt;em&gt;dashi&lt;/em&gt; which is typically made using &lt;em&gt;bonito&lt;/em&gt; fish flakes. There may be fish or meat in places you least expect it. I once bought a slice of cheese pizza with nori on top only to discover a layer of cooked salmon underneath the cheese. At convenience stores, salads often have ham or some kind of meat on top. In restaurants, often times the only “safe” foods for strict vegetarians will be plain rice and seaweed. Larger cities will usually have more options for vegetarians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pocket Wifi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you are confident enough in your Japanese, get a pocket wifi. Some air bnbs’ provide pocket wifis but obviously getting to the next location will be difficult without your own. If you really want to avoid purchasing pocket wifi like I did, you can take dozens of detailed screenshots of Google Maps. (Note: offline maps do not seem to be available in many parts of Japan.) Download all offline maps you need before getting to Japan, there’s a handy app call maps.me which is extremely useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cash &amp;amp; ATM’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cash is still king in Japan. 7-11’s and other larger chains have ATM’s you can use to withdraw cash.
